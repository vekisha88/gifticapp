# Giftic App Developer Profile

This file contains information about my preferences and working style as a developer of the Giftic app.

## Coding Preferences

- I prefer **concise solutions** that prioritize readability and maintainability over clever one-liners
- I value **consistent patterns** across the codebase for better team collaboration
- I appreciate **proactive error handling** that anticipates failure points
- I prefer **small, focused components** and functions rather than large monolithic ones

## Architectural Preferences

- I'm following a **modular architecture** with clear separation of concerns
- I prefer to keep **business logic in services** rather than controllers or components
- I like to use **repository pattern** for database access when appropriate
- I value **strict typing** with TypeScript throughout the codebase

## Working Style

- I usually work **iteratively**, building core functionality first before refining
- I prefer **self-documenting code** with descriptive variable and function names
- I value **practical solutions** over perfect ones, especially in early development
- I appreciate **specific examples** when learning new patterns or approaches

## Technical Areas

Areas I'm most experienced with:
- TypeScript & JavaScript
- React & React Native
- Express.js
- MongoDB

Areas I'm currently learning or less experienced with:
- Solidity development
- Blockchain integration
- Smart contract testing
- Advanced MongoDB optimization

## Documentation Preferences

- I prefer **markdown-based documentation** for technical specs
- I like **commented examples** that show both intended usage and edge cases
- I value **API documentation** that clearly explains parameters and return types
